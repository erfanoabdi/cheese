    + Added. Fallback to videotestsrc if getting information from the video
      device fails
  * debian/patches/20_dont_start_pipeline_in_init.patch:
    + Added. Don't create the gstreamer pipeline in the Webcam object

      fixes cheese not using the webcam device set in gconf.
  * debian/copyright: Updated
